# Nootropic Information Website
This is a website providing information about some types of Nootropics. Particularly focusing on dietary supplements that are natural and known to be safe and effective.

 Nootropics are substances, often in the form of supplements (but can be derived from food) that individuals use to potentially enhance cognitive function which people report benefits such as improved memory, increased focus, increased productivity, the ability to learn new skills quickly and  reduced feelings of stress which is likely due to lowered levels of the stress hormone cortisol.
