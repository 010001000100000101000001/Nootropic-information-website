### Additional Notes
Given more time and considering my current commitments, I would focus on enhancing the performance of the website by conducting an audit of the `style.css` file and implementing optimizations to improve loading times. This could involve:

- **CSS Optimization**: Auditing the `style.css` file to identify opportunities for optimization, such as removing unused styles, consolidating similar styles, and minifying the CSS to reduce file size.
  
- **Image Optimization**: Evaluating the images used on the website and optimizing their sizes to reduce bandwidth consumption and improve loading speed. This could involve compressing images without sacrificing quality.

- **Code Minification**: Minifying HTML and CSS files to reduce file sizes and improve load times.

- **Caching Strategies**: Implementing caching strategies such as browser caching and server-side caching to store static assets and reduce server load and response times for returning visitors.

- The website uses Font Awesome icons for enhanced user experience and design.
