                    L-theanine: Known for its calming and relaxing properties, L-theanine is present in tea leaves,
                    particularly in
                    green tea. When coupled with caffeine, it can lessen the jittery side effects and increase focus and
                    attentiveness.

                <p>
                    Tea (Camellia sinensis): L-theanine is present in considerable amounts in green tea. Although
                    L-theanine
                    is also
                    present in black tea, the fermentation process may have reduced the amount of the chemical.

                <p>
                    Supplements: Tea leaves are a common source of L-theanine, which is available as a supplement. These
                    supplements
                    are available in a range of dosages and as powders, tablets, and capsules.

                    Two forms of omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are
                    particularly important for human health. Omega-3 fatty acids are a type of polyunsaturated fat.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are several varieties of omega-3 supplements, including liquid and pills, that are made from
                    fish oil or algae.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the proper development and operation of the brain, omega-3 fatty acids are essential. They are
                    essential elements of the cell membrane that affect neurotransmission, signaling, and membrane
                    fluidity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Numerous ways exist for omega-3 fatty acids to potentially improve cognitive function, according to
                    research:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Better Brain Structure: DHA in particular plays a significant role in brain development and
                        maintenance as a structural component of the brain.</li>
                    <li>Enhanced Neurotransmission: The function of neurotransmitters, which impacts mood, memory, and
                        cognition, may be supported by omega-3 fatty acids.</li>
                    <li>Decreased Inflammation: Prolonged inflammation may have a detrimental effect on memory. Because
                        of their anti-inflammatory qualities, omega-3s may be beneficial to brain health.</li>

                    <li>
                        Stress Reduction: Rhodiola may help reduce stress and anxiety by controlling stress hormones
